I had an absolutely horrible experience at this clinic. I waited for over three hours past my appointment time, and when I finally saw the doctor, they were incredibly rude and dismissive. They didn't listen to any of my concerns and rushed through the appointment in less than five minutes. The staff was unprofessional and the facility was filthy. I left feeling completely disrespected and worse than when I arrived. I will never go back and I strongly advise everyone to avoid this place at all costs.
